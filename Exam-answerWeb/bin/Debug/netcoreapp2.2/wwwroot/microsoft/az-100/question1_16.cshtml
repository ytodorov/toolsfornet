        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You should create a tag named CostCenter and assign it to each resource group. Creating a tag and assigning it to each resource group allows you to easily identify the cost center associated with each resource group. When you associate a tag with a resource or resource group, you need to provide a value to that tag. You can instruct the accounting department to use the Azure Cost Management tool to review the costs associated with each cost center by filtering by the newly created tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should also create a tag named CostCenter and assign it to each resource. If you apply a tag to a resource group, that tag is not inherited by the resources in the resource group. You need to manually configure the tag for each resource that you want to include in the cost center. You can automate this action by using a PowerShell or Azure CLI script.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not instruct the accounting department to use either the Cost Analysis blade in the subscription panel or the Azure Account Center. Because your subscription is managed by a Cloud Service Provider, you can get that information from your provider. You can also get this information by using the Azure Cost Management tool.
