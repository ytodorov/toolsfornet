        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You should use Azure File Recovery to retrieve individual files from a backed-up VM in Azure. You start Azure File Recovery from the VM's Settings page in the Azure portal. The process involves downloading a small executable program file that mounts the VM's virtual hard disks (VHDs) as local drives on your system. You should then transfer the files you need and then close the connection to complete the procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should not use Azure Site Recovery (ASR). It is used to migrate or configure disaster recovery for one or more on-premises or cloud-based VMs. Likewise, you should not initiate a test failover or commit a recovery point because these are ASR tasks and not related to Azure File Recovery.
