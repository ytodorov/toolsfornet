        Explanation
        <div>
            <p>
                You cannot use more than one Azure file share in the same sync group. An Azure file share is represented by a cloud endpoint. You can only have one cloud endpoint per sync group. You can add as many server endpoints as you want. You should think of sync groups as the replication hub in the sync process.
            </p>
            <p>
                A server can sync with multiple sync groups. You can configure as many server endpoints as you need in a single server and each endpoint can be synced with different sync groups. This means that you can have the same server synced with a different sync group as long as you use different server endpoints. Remember that you cannot use NAS or mounted shares as server endpoints, and tiering will be applied only to those endpoints that are not stored in a system volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Changes made directly on the file share can take up to 24 to be synced. You can make changes directly on an Azure file share that is a member of a sync group, but you should bear in mind that this change will not be effective until the change is discovered by the Azure File Sync change detection job that runs every 24 hours. This means that, in the worst case, a change made directly on the Azure file share can take up to 24 to be synced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pre-seeding is not the best approach for doing the first synchronization. When you onboard with Azure File Sync you typically prefer to have a zero-downtime synchronization. You can achieve this by using only one server that hosts the dataset that you will sync and perform the first synchronization with this server. Once this first synchronization is done, you can add any additional server to the sync group. If you use pre-seeding, you need to manually copy all the datasets to the Azure file share using a mechanism like SMB copy or Robocopy. If you decide to use this method, you need to ensure that you can afford the downtime and that there will not be any changes to the dataset.
